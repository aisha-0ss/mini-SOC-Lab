🛡️ SOC (Security Operation Center) Lab

The SOC (Security Operation Center) Lab I developed is designed to simulate, investigate and test real-world cyberattacks in a controlled environment. 
This hands-on project focuses on understanding both offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques.

🔹 Part 1: Exploitation – Reverse Shell Attack via Email Phishing
In the first phase, I targeted a Windows 10 machine acting as a victim system. The attack vector is email phishing, which delivers a malicious payload.
Once the payload is executed by the victim, a reverse shell connection will be established, providing me with command-line interface (CLI) access to the victim machine.

This stage includes:
📦 Payload creation and delivery
🔗 Session establishment using Meterpreter
🛠️ Post-exploitation techniques such as: Persistence, File system interaction, Lateral movement, Data exfiltration
